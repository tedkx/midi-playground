# My MODX midi playground

---

## Short term roadmap

### Midi Sequencer

- ~~Basic buttons (start/stop)~~
- Basic controls (tempo, transpose, midi channels, note duration)
- Pad note up/down visual indication (notes left on either direction)
- Number of pattern pads
- Scales other than chromatic
- Pattern randomization
- Multiple parallel patterns
- Maybe use AudioContext metronome instead of/in conjuction with setInterval

### Altered Scale Practice

- Fix elusive bug sometimes making chrome hang

### Sequencer with AudioContext oscilators
