# My MODX midi playground

---

## Short term roadmap

### Midi Sequencer

- [x] Basic buttons (start/stop)
- [x] Knob click event
- [x] Basic controls (tempo, transpose, midi channels, note duration)
- [x] Number of pattern pads
- [x] Change NoteValue parameter to dropdown
- [x] Multiple parallel patterns
- [ ] Parallel patterns reset meters count
- [ ] Step recording
- [ ] Pad note up/down visual indication (notes left on either direction)
- [ ] Scales other than chromatic
- [ ] Pattern randomization
- [ ] Pre-made pattern selection
- [ ] Import/export to midi
- [ ] Central midi message handling instead of each componen using input/output
- [ ] Maybe use AudioContext metronome instead of/in conjuction with setInterval

### Altered Scale Practice

- Fix elusive bug sometimes making chrome hang

### Sequencer with AudioContext oscilators
