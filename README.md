# My MODX midi playground

---

## Short term roadmap

### Midi Sequencer

- [x] Basic buttons (start/stop)
- [ ] Knob click event
- [ ] Basic controls ([x] tempo, [x] transpose, midi channels, note duration)
- [ ] Pre-made pattern selection
- [ ] Pad note up/down visual indication (notes left on either direction)
- [ ] Number of pattern pads
- [ ] Scales other than chromatic
- [ ] Pattern randomization
- [ ] Multiple parallel patterns
- [ ] Maybe use AudioContext metronome instead of/in conjuction with setInterval

### Altered Scale Practice

- Fix elusive bug sometimes making chrome hang

### Sequencer with AudioContext oscilators
